  - title: Complete rework of how settings work
    description: Before some settings were nothing more than mere variables that got a value via some ini file, all cramped up in one, very chaotic class. Now it is written in a very easily maintainable and expandable structure that allows for default values, limits etc., all nicely lined up in a separate package. It is technically a whole settings framework. There is a help page for the settins to explain how to use them, or just ask Anders how to set them.
Bug Fixes:
  - title: People that leave are now announced both with their name and their mention in the admin channel
    description: When someone is mentioned you are not friends with and share no server with the mention is shown as just some formatted numbers after a relogin, which is useless.
  - title: Fixed issue with numbers given to commands causing an exception if higher or lower than certain, very high limits
    description: These arguments are handled internally as Integer-type values, which may range from -2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647. If the given number is higher or lower than these limits Java complains, and I have to catch this. Now that is done. Bug found by <@313756822735552522>
