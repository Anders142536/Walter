Bug Fixes:
  - title: Fixed issue of patchnotes being sent to the news channel in the wrong order if they exceeded the message length limit of 2000 characters
    description: This causes them to be split into smaller messages, and those were send in a wrong order, due to me being an idiot and always creating a new WebhookClient to send the single messages. According to the author of the library im using for the Webhooks the way I use them now is the intended way and shoooouuuuld work.
