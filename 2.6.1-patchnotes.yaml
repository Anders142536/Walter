name: Commands Update
New Features:
  - title: Integer arguments have limits now
    description: These will not be displayed in the help pages, but you will be told so if you hit a limit.
  - title: Added "!pin" command on request of <@628516712043773952>
    description: The command is limited to members, so i trust everyone to use this responsibly and not abuse it.
  - title: Added "!lockdown" command
    description: Lockdown means that the automatic assignment of the guest role will no longer happen. This is for the case of invite link leakage or spam joining in general. This command is admin only. If this happens you will be notified in the news channel.
  - title: The foyer is active again, but with wrong texts in there.
  - title: Added "!react" command
    description: Allows members to let walter add reactions to messages
Optimizations:
  - title: Patchnotes now also show the version they are made for in the title
  - title: tags in "!getmsg" results will no longer push notifications
    description: If a tag is added to a message via editing it does not push a notification. Now the message is sent empty first and the metainformation embed is edited into it afterwards. Please tell me if this does not work as expected.
  - title: When someone leaves, they are now mentioned instead of writing their names as text.
    description: Only admins can see these messages.
  - title: The minimum required Role for "!say" is now lowered to Member
Bug Fixes:
  - title: "!roll" now checks if the list of numbers became too long
    description: Before it was throwing an exception that was displayed. To a non-programmer that might look confusing af, so I changed that
  - title: fixed issue of "!getmsg" not showing the correct nickname after the user in brackets
    description: It always showed the nickname of the user who issued the command, as the nickname was fetched from the wrong object. Maybe writing 700 lines of code in one sitting was not the beeeeest of ideas >.>
